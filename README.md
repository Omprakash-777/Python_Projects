# ❤️‍🔥 FLAMES Game – Mini Project (Python)

Welcome to the **FLAMES Game**, a fun and nostalgic compatibility game built using Python! This mini project takes two names as input and predicts the relationship using the popular "FLAMES" logic.

## 🔥 What is FLAMES?

**FLAMES** stands for:
- **F** – Friends  
- **L** – Love  
- **A** – Affection  
- **M** – Marriage

The game removes common characters between two names and counts the remaining characters to determine the relationship using the FLAMES acronym.
